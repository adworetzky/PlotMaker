# PlotMaker MKII

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Description

PlotMaker MK2 is a processing application I created that allows the user to take advantage of the generative power of their computer. The application reads image data and displaces a predetermined set of lines to “draw” the image onto 4 separate CMYK layers. But the real power comes in the abstraction of the original form through this process.

Images can be sourced from Unsplash.com directly or the user can drag and drop their own into the window. With variable resizing of the output, any specific sizing can be generated using just a few clicks.
The application also adds elements of randomness and noise to the final output to create a remix of the original image.

This final output can be exported and plotted using a pen plotter such as the iDraw or the Axidraw easily because of the spliced layer output.

## Requirements 
```bash
import processing.svg.*;
import de.ixdhof.hershey.*;
import controlP5.*;
import drop.*;
```
The sketch needs the processing SVG library, HersheyText library, ControlP5 library, and the Drop library. All are available within the native processing library manager. Install before use and then run!
